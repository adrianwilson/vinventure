VinVenture is a mobile-first SaaS application that connects wine enthusiasts with unique wine experiences offered by vineyards and wineries. It allows users to discover, book, and review wine tastings, tours, and virtual events. Wineries can register on the platform, manage their listings, and process bookings.
